        <p class="aboutText">
            We started creating pillows becuase we realized throughout different stages of our lives, we we have
            different
            needs and different colors that are shaped by our environement. We made soft and springy plush pillows, made
            for
            snoozing, relaxing, and accesorizing.
            They have the perfect fill so you can max out on comfort.<br><br>

                <h2 class='filltitle'>duck down</h2>
                <p class='filldesc'>Down makes for a buoyant, plush pillow because its clusters are incredibly efficient
                    at trapping air. Feathers are less pliant, and play an important role as a "pillow-within-a-pillow"
                    support in creating firmer pillows.</p>

                <h2 class='filltitle'>hypoallergenic poly-blend</h2>
                <p class='filldesc'>Cotton combined with polyester is less prone to pilling and static. Today’s
                    poly-cotton blends are softer than their predecessors. This type of fabric keeps it shape and color
                    longer, it doesn’t shrink, and helps those with extreme allergies.</p>

                <h2 class='filltitle'>memory foam</h2>
                <p class='filldesc'>Memory foam pillows are special because of the heat reactive cushioning insulator.
                    When pressure is applied along with heat, the foam reshapes itself to conform to the object. This is
                    why memory foam pillows shape to the head and neck better than other pillows.</p>
